`racket-review` performs surface-level linting of individual Racket
modules with the intent of finding issues as quickly as it can. It
does not expand the programs it lints, so there may be cases where
it is wrong, but, in practice, it performs reasonably well on `#lang
racket{,/base}` programs.

It currently reports the following issues:

* `[error]` "identifier is already defined"
* `[error]` "if expressions must contain one expression for the then-branch and another for the else-branch"
* `[error]` "let forms must contain at least one body expression"
* `[error]` "syntax error"
* `[error]` "use _ instead of else in the fallthrough case of a match expression"
* `[error]` "case clause must be in the form (<const> ...), not '<const>"
* `[error]` "use '() for match pattern instead of null or empty"
* `[warning]` "bindings within a let should be surrounded by square brackets"
* `[warning]` "identifier * provided but not defined"
* `[warning]` "identifier * is already defined"
* `[warning]` "identifier * is never used"
* `[warning]` "identifier * shadows an earlier binding"
* `[warning]` "missing module (#lang) declaration"
* `[warning]` "require (for-syntax ...) should come before all others"
* `[warning]` "require * should come after *"
* `[warning]` "require * should come before *"
* `[warning]` "this cond expression does not have an else clause"
* `[warning]` "use a cond expression instead of nesting begin or let inside an if"

Various packages provide [extensions] to these rules.

## Setup

    $ raco pkg install review

## Usage

    $ raco review filename.rkt

To tell the linter to ignore an entire module, add a comment like

``` racket
#|review: ignore|#
```

to the source file. To tell it to ignore a particular line, end that
line with one of the following comments:

``` racket
;; noqa
;; lint: ignore
;; review: ignore
```

## Adding Custom Rules

**Note: this protocol is currently experimental and subject to change.
If you use it in your own packages, please let me know.**

A package may declare its own linting rules by providing a `review-exts`
definition in its top-level `info.rkt` file. Each `review-exts`
definition is a list of triples, where the first value is an absolute
module path, the second is the name of a predicate procedure provided by
that module, and the third is the name of a linting procedure provided
by that module.

Both the predicate and the linting procedure must take a single syntax
object as argument. The linting procedure is called on a piece of syntax
whenever the predicate procedure returns `#t`.

For an example, see [this package][ext example].

## Emacs/flycheck support

Add the following snippet to your `init.el` to define a Flycheck
checker for `racket-review`:

``` emacs-lisp
(flycheck-define-checker racket-review
  "check racket source code using racket-review"
  :command ("raco" "review" source)
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":error:" (message) line-end)
   (warning line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":warning:" (message) line-end))
  :modes racket-mode)

(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'racket-review)
```

Or install the Emacs plugin from the `elisp` directory:

```shell
(cd elisp && make install)
```
